 # Question 2
 
 Fascinated by the snowfall at Lakefield College School, you resolve to write an augmented-reality app that will use a phone's camera, and time-lapse photography, to track snowfall amounts for each day.
 
 ![snowfallatlcs](snowfallatlcs.png "Having fun with snow at LCS")
 
 The following pieces of information will be tracked each hour:
 
 * date of this measurement
 * time of this measurement
 * current height of snow outside window in centimetres
 
 Additionally, the app will keep track of, overall:
 
 * total snowfall over entire year so far
 
 For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.

// Answer question 2 below

let dateOfMeasurement = "December 19 2017"
let timeOfMeasurement = "9:00"
var currentHeightOfSnowInMilimeters = 50

var totalSnowfallOverYear = 50
    
print("I used constants for the date and time of measurement because at the time the")
print("measurement was taken will never change. However, the current height of the snow will")
print("and total snowfall will be constantly changed as they are updated to the new data,")
print("making them better as variables.")
